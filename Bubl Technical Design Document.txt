Pitch: Imagine a social platform that helps students transition from elementary school to middle school. Bubl is a school specific social network and friendship connection tool.


MVP: User can create an account, join an existing school account, and search for existing Bubls to join. They can explore interests through hashtag searches. They can connect with others and share experiences.
	Proposal
Bubl helps make it easier for young students to transition to the next stage in their educational career. Students can create an account connected to their school, connect with other students in the same school, and join different groups based on different interests. By making these shared interests easier to discover and organize, Bubl helps ease students into creating new, deeper friendships so they can be more effective students sooner.

For Data Scientists
________________




- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app


Target Audience
________________


* Who is your target audience? Be specific.
   * Elementary school students moving into middle school.
* What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
* Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?


Research 
________________


- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)
________________


* This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
   * Message board with comments: 
      * Frontend: 1 day (estimated 3 days)
      * Backend:  1 day (estimated 3 days)
